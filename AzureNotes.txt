Devops is a combination of tools, practices, cultural philosophy that helps in delivering high quality software faster and more quality through automation and collaboration.

Gate Management in Devops: It acts as a control checkpoint. It has a gate where it checks whether the process can be moved to further stage or not.


Different Cloud Service Models

IaaS ( Infrastructure as a Service): It is a model where complete infrastructure is provided by the cloud provider such as virtual machines, storage, networks

Advantages:
Complete Control
Access to any type of cloud resource
Pay as you go
Scalability
Elastic IP: Assigned fixed public IP to a resource
Self service provisioning: It defines defining resources on our own 

Different ways to access and create resources in Azure:

i) Azure ARM Template
ii) Azure Bicep
iii) Azure Portal
iv) Terraform

Categories of Cloud:
	Public: Shared all over the world
	Private: Shared across a organization or a group
	Hybrid: Mix of Public and Private clouds


PaaS ( Platform as a Service ): It provides a platform to deploy and develop the applications. You can consider all NFRs can come under the PaaS.
Advantages:
	Scalability
	Deployment & Control
	Ownership & control
	Data & Application Responsibility
	
SaaS ( Software as a Service ): It provides software applications to ready use
Advantages of SaaS:
	Web based access
	Multi tenant architecture
	Accessibility from anywhere
	Lower upfront cost
	Scalability
	Flexibility
	Accessibility
	Usability

Strategy- long term
Tactics - Short term steps taken to solve Non Functional Requirements

Bastian Host:  Acts as a controlled intermediary that administrators or users can use to access internal virtual machines (VMs) without exposing those VMs directly to the internet.

Zone: Independent Data center in a region
Vnet: It is a network that spans across a region. Vnet is specific to account. Its scope is across region. We can add multiple subnets and their range while creating Vnet. 
In Azure 
	1st IP address is reserved for Network Address
	2nd IP address is reserved for Azure Internal Use that is for to manage the Azure infrastructure of Vnet and its resources.
	3rd IP address is also reserved for Azure's internal use. This address is often used for the VNet gateway or other Azure services that require a dedicated IP for management and routing purposes.
V net peering: It allows to pair the two regions and one machine from one region can talk to another machine in another region through private address.
Scaleset Service: Autoscale the number of vms. We need to create load balancer infront of a scale set.
Fault Domain: Distribute VMs across multiple fault domains
Azure Files: It is a managed file share service in the cloud that uses the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It allows multiple clients to mount and share files concurrently.

Resource group: In azure resource group is a container that holds related resources for azure solution. It is logically grouping of resources that allows to manage and organize them collectively.

Azure Subscription is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure. It is associated with a specific Azure account and is used to manage billing and access to Azure services.

Network Security Group (NSG) is a set of security rules that allow or deny inbound and outbound network traffic to Azure resources.

Rules: Each NSG can contain multiple rules, and rules are processed in priority order. The first rule that matches the traffic will apply.
Association: NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces, allowing for granular control over traffic


Vnet is created with 3 subnets such as frontend, backend, private with private as private that is by default outbound access is blocked. After that Network security groups were created such as public and private. The public NSG subnet is associated with frontend and backend where as private NSG subnet is associated with private. The virtual machines are created with frontend,backend,private with no public IP to the backend. Then in NSGs the private Inbound rules  is changed with the only backend VM can access.

Azure Global Infrastructure:

Geography
Region
Availability Zones
Region pairs: two regions within the same geography with atleast 300 miles apart
Edge locations: are datacenters or facilities providing Azure services closer to end-users (outside the Azure regional network).
Used by Azure CDN and Azure Front Door for caching and traffic acceleration.
Reduces latency and improves performance for end-users globally.
Cloud CDN ( Content Delivery Network ): global distributed network of servers that cache and deliver web content, video, and files at high speed.
ARM ( Azure Resource Manager ):  is the deployment and management service for Azure resources 

Account: An Azure Account is tied to an email address and is used to sign in and manage Azure subscriptions and resources.
Grants  billing and/or administrative access.



Entra ID: User entry in the azure database
	Refers to a user object in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).
Represents a single person, device, or service that can authenticate against Azure resources.

Tenant: An Azure Tenant is a dedicated, isolated instance of Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
Provides identity and access management for users, groups, and applications.
Each tenant is unique and associated with a single organization.
TenantID
Management Groups: are containers for managing access, policy, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions.

Hierarchy:
Microsoft Entra ID (Tenant)
    └── Management Groups (optional, hierarchical)
          └── Subscriptions
                └── Resource Groups
                      └── Resources

Vnets creation and Vnet peering through Azure CLI:
So that the machines in different Vnets can talk with each other using private address so that it
can communicate using azure internet capabilities which decreases latency.

Managed Identities
	Managed Identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (AAD) for Azure resources.
	Allows resources to authenticate to services that support AAD authentication without storing credentials in code.
	Two types: System-assigned (tied to the lifecycle of the resource) and User-assigned (standalone identity that can be assigned to multiple resources).
Automation Account
	An Azure Automation Account is a container for automation resources, including runbooks, schedules, and assets.
	It provides a way to automate frequent tasks, such as deployment, monitoring, and management of Azure resources.
	Supports process automation, configuration management, and update management.
Runbook
	A Runbook is a script or workflow hosted in an Automation Account to automate tasks.
	Can be authored in PowerShell, PowerShell Workflow, Python, or graphical.
	Runbooks can be triggered manually, on a schedule, or by webhooks to perform operations like starting/stopping VMs, managing resources, etc.
Jobs (in Automation)
	A Job is the execution instance of a runbook. Tracks the status, output, and error messages of a runbook execution. 	Multiple jobs can run concurrently depending on the Automation Account configuration.
Azure Functions
	Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-driven code without managing infrastructure. 	Supports multiple languages such as C#, JavaScript, Python, and more. Automatically scales based on demand and you only pay for execution time.

Function App
	A Function App is the hosting container for one or more Azure Functions.
	Provides a way to group related functions, share configuration, and manage deployment.
	Manages resources like storage, runtime version, and scaling for the contained functions.

Terraform:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Different categories of IAC:
1.  Infrastructure provisioning tools – terraform (multi cloud) , Boto3,  cloud formation, Azure Bicep, Azure ARM Template,
	The above are used to create or provide infrastructure. We can also modify the infrastructure. If we are modifying then again the services are recreated rather than updating the existing one, so it is called the Provisioning tool.
2.   Configuration management tool – Ansible, puppet, chef
	These tools are used for modifying the infrastructure configurations.
Configuration drift/ snowflakes
      		Ansible works on push and pull model.
      		In the pull model you should install agents.
      		Push model is suggested.
3.  Server Templating tool – vagrant, docker.
It helps to create a servers 
AgroCD/ FluxCD : 
	Automate continuous delivery of infrastructure and code using Git as the source of truth. These are not classic
provisioning or configuration tools but fit into declarative and automated infrastructure workflows by keeping
environments synchronized with code repositories.

Terraform 

	Database execution plan
	tf Files: You define desired resources and configurations in .tf files.
	Terraform Plan: This command checks changes between the current state and the desired state 
	Terraform Apply: This command applies the plan and modifies the infrastructure as defined.
	State File: Terraform keeps track of the resources it manages in a state file, which must be managed carefully

Creating a Virtual Machine ScaleSet using Azure Portal
Steps to Create a VMSS
Create a VM:
	Install a Single Page Application (SPA) like Apache on it.
Capture an Image:
	Once the VM is running and configured, capture its image.
	Delete the original VM after capturing the image.
Create a VMSS:
	Navigate to VM Scale Set in Azure Portal.
	Select the appropriate resource group, location, and the previously saved image.
Configure Networking:
	Use the existing VNET (created with the original VM).
	Edit the VNET to create two subnets: one public and one private.
	Add the private subnet to the network interface.
Configure Load Balancer:
	Create a Load Balancer.
	Retain the default configuration:
Frontend IP: Public IP
Frontend port: 80
Backend pool:  VMSS pool
Backend port: 80
Probe: Linked to  health probe
Key Load Balancer Configuration
Frontend IP: Public IP
Frontend port: 80
Backend pool: VMSS pool
Backend port: 80
Probe: Health probe for monitoring instance health
The public IP address of the Load Balancer is used to access your application.
